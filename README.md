## Why was this mod created?

I noticed that people have tended to lean towards a Minecraft-style GUI (due to OptiFine's vanilla GUI video settings menu) over a more modern interface,
so this is why I decided to create this mod. It also contains all the features of [YACL-Forge](https://github.com/TexTrueStudio/YetAnotherConfigLib-Forge),
including search and collapsable groups.

## Supported Sodium add-ons

This mod works with the following Sodium GUI add-ons:

- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)
- [Sodium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra)

Most others will _probably work_, if not [make sure to report them!](https://github.com/isXander/xanders-sodium-options/issues)
